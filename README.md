# _BeamNG.ui_

This project is working on the User Interface of the vehicle simulator 

## Project Setup

As BeamNG uses the [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/), it is very simple to develop, test and integrate the UI: simply develop in Chrome or Firefox :)

## Demo

## Testing

There are no (automated) tests yet, but they will be done at some point.

## Deploying

If you entered the BeamNG Alpha and are using at least version 0.3.1 (which is not released to general public as of 24/01/2014), you can replace the content of the /html/ folder with this repository's content.

## Working Features

* Basic UI with JS with basic message system

## Planned Things

* Internationalization
* System tests and unit tests
* Usage of jQuery widgets to make the UI Much more modular
